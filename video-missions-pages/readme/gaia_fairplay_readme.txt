I. INTRODUCTION
=========================
This five minute long cutscene was made for the OFPEC cutscene competition. The video is about how I imagined "Armed Assault" to be - no tank battalions, no infantry divisions, no air raids, just one resistance squad and one BMP. War can look anonymous, but for everyone involved it's personel bussines.


II. ADDON REQUIREMENTS

Play without unoffical mods.
